# launchyxl
Quick Launcher for Excel

Launchy XL is a small & lightweight Excel addin to help you quickly and easily find your favorite files â€“ without coding a single line yourself.
You can load the addin and instantly filter in the loaded list, start by typing in the search box.
You can decide if you prefer to have a "all in one" list, or use multiple lists to further organize the contents.

You can always open the LaunchyXL.xlam directly in Excel, to have the functionality added to your current Excel session. 
The preferred method is to add the file as an Excel addin.

It's possible to share a collection of lists (via a config file) with a team - to further improve productivity.
It's possible to edit the collection of links via the addin itself - or via any text editor. The logic is as simple as:

id,filepath,description
